Your habit of wanting to get things right immediately comes from perfectionism and fear of feeling stupid, not from anything being wrong with you. Your brain is trying to protect you by avoiding mistakes, because mistakes feel like a loss of control or wasted time.

But in programming, mistakes are necessary — they’re how you build real skills like debugging, flexible thinking, and creativity. Avoiding mistakes actually slows your progress.

Following professional structures is fine, but you should still think through problems yourself. Your creativity isn’t gone; you’re just uncomfortable with uncertainty, which is normal.

A good way to break this habit is the “5-minute imperfect start”: spend a few minutes writing messy code or ideas without worrying about correctness. This trains your brain to accept mistakes as part of learning.

Nothing is wrong with you — this is a common stage for disciplined learners.
