"I know you're grateful and all but... Are you really doing this?"

- Yes

"Fine, welcome to Gensokyo."

"You don't have to do anything grand. All you have to do is pray to the shrine and offer your faith.

- How do I offer my faith?

"Well, faith is garnered from your spirit and mind. The effort you put in every day, your commitment to something you wish to achieve, anything that leads to personal growth."

"Complete the tasks you believe are important in your life. Each task symbolizes a commitment or a small personal victory that strengthens your spirit and resolve."

"Although, I would appreciate it more if those tasks involved maintaining the shrine. Hehe."
